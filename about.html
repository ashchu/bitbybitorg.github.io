           Bit by Bit is an organization that breaks code into 1s and 0s by hosting free crash course robotics and programming workshops. Our workshops are geared towards girls and students from low-income backgrounds in 6th-8th grade who wouldn’t initially pursue a career in technology. 
           <br>
           We have two types of programs currently in the works: 
           <ol>
             <li>
                 Every friday after school, we meet with out students at the local community center on Bay Farm Island where students work in teams to experiment different hands-on projects and have loads of fun, with fun games such as “wah” and snacks during breaks.
             </li>
             <br>
             <li>
               Our monthly Spring 2018 Program is starting on March 2nd, 2018! We hope this program will spread to more middle school students across Alameda as we are partnering with the Alameda Main Library Branch to host programming workshops in their computer lab from 3:15 to 5:00pm every first Thursday of the month. March 2nd is are only Friday date. Come join the fun and learn more on are "Outreach" Page!

    </div>

    <p style = "padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%; text-align: center;"> Our founder first fully recognized the issue of diversity in technology when I attended my first hackathon and joined an all-guys team. With her team, she barely had a say on both her role on the project and the idea for the teams app. Yet, on the bright side, her experience with her team enlightened her on the reality of the issue of diversity in technology and the “imposter syndrome” that many other students, especially those who are underrepresented in technology, feel. After talking with other professionals and high school students interested in technology, she realized that many girls and people of color struggled with similar issues that she faced. The source of this problem is that as children grow up, many kids struggle to believe in themselves as movies and advertisements generally fail to see people like them in technology roles. She decided to take charge of this issue by developing Bit by Bit. Bit by Bit works to develop programming workshops to underrepresented students to help inspire them and prepare them for 21st century careers. We especially focus on robotics because is critical to the future of innovation and connects the different parts of STEAM together to solve problems in communities. Our passion for Bit by Bit is to teach the next generation of innovators that they can be bold, brave, and beautiful by following their passions and believing that they have the potential to reach for their dreams.
